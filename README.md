# Team Jishui COVID-19 Information Dashboard

## Dashboard Overview

Our COVID-19 information dashboard is a web application that shows general COVID-19 data for the entirety of the United States. This data includes the number of Cases, the number of Recoveries, 
the number of Active Cases, and the number of Deaths due to Coronavirus within the United States. The website also has bar graphs that display the Recovered Cases to Deaths ratio and the **insert info about second bar graph**.


## How To Use the Dashboard

To start the website, please use `npm start` in a terminal, which will open up the app on on your `local host 3000`. 
From there you will be able to see all of the available COVID-19 data.
You can also create an account using our Login and Signup pages!
